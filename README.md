# Delaware County Fair Auction App
This app is in tandem with the desktop app [here](https://github.com/danield33/DelawareCountyAuction).

## Description
This app was designed for the intent of being able to select participants in an auction to be selected and displayed on all the devices connected to a web-socket server running on a device. Without the server running and properly connected, it will not work as intended. You can find the web-socket [here](https://github.com/danield33/AuctionWebsocket).

## Usage
To use this app, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
